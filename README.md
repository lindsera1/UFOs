# UFOs

## Overview

In this project, I helped my friend Dana build a website which showcased her interest for UFOs.
In particular, we wanted to create a website that was dedicated to providing recorded UFO sightings across
the country. The intent was to spread awareness about the possibility of the existence of UFOs on UFO day.
Our particular approach was simply to allow users to filter their search based on criteria of shape, city, state
country, and date. 

## Results

This was the final result of our work:

The website was very user friendly and visually appealing, if I say so myself. There was an aesthetically appealing layout for the search 
items, as well as the display of the table. All elements were spaced out, and nothing was terribly cluttered.

Here I've included how the website functions with search criteria; the results are inclusive rather than exclusive; we'll include all of texas, and benton, and 
sightings on 1/2/2010.

All users must do is type in the desired criteria, and if there is a match, they will see a filtered search result returned.

## Summary

I was fairly enthusiastic about this website; to be even more convincing, we could go so far as to include links to other UFO sighting pages; we could feature new 
articles, and updated sighting info through webscraping; possibly implant videos or declassified footage. The opportunities to expand this website are rather 
endless, and it would be a worthwhile project to invest some more time into making the website more user interactive. Overall, we have a great foundation to start
and am looking forward to further development of this webpage.
